.SH DESCRIPTION
.B s2p
emulates SCSI and SASI devices with the Raspberry Pi and a PiSCSI/RaSCSI board.
.PP
In the arguments to s2p one or more SCSI (-i n[:u]) or SASI (-h n[:u]) devices can be specified. SCSI and SASI devices cannot be mixed.
The number (n) after the ID or HD identifier specifies the ID number for that device. The optional number (u) specifies the LUN (logical unit) for that device. The default LUN is 0.
The ID is limited from 0-7. However, typically SCSI ID 7 is reserved for the "initiator" (the host computer). The LUN is limited from 0-31 for SCSI and 0-1 for SASI.
.PP
If no explicit device type is provided, s2p determines the type based upon the file extension of the FILE argument.
    hd1: SCSI Hard Disk image (generic, non-removable, SCSI-1)
    hds: SCSI Hard Disk image (generic, non-removable, SCSI-2)
    hdr: SCSI Hard Disk image (generic, removable, SCSI-2)
    hda: SCSI Hard Disk image (Apple compatible - typically used with Macintosh computers, but also compatible with any other, SCSI-2)
    mos: SCSI Magneto-Optical image (MO/MOD, SCSI-2)
    is1: SCSI CD-ROM or DVD-ROM image (ISO 9660, SCSI-1)
    iso, cdr, toast: SCSI CD-ROM or DVD-ROM image (ISO 9660, SCSI-2)
  
For example, if you want to specify an Apple-compatible HD image on ID 0, you can use the following command:
    s2p -id 0 /path/to/drive/hdimage.hda

When s2p starts it opens a socket (default port is 6868) to allow external management commands. Examples for management tools are s2pctl or the SCSI Control app.

To quit s2p press Control-C. If it is running in the background, you can kill it using an INT signal. When terminating s2p automatically flushes all cached data.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-C\fI " " \fIPROPERTY_FILE
The optional property file with s2p configuration data. The default property file is ~/.config/s2p.properties.
.TP
.BR \-b\fI " " \fIBLOCK_SIZE
The optional sector size, either 256, 512, 1024, 2048 or 4096 bytes. Default size is 512 bytes.
.TP
.BR \-F\fI " " \fIFOLDER
The default folder for image files. For files in this folder no absolute path needs to be specified. The default folder is '~/images'.
.TP
.BR \-L\fI " " \fILOG_LEVEL[:ID:[LUN]]
The s2p log level (trace, debug, info, warning, error, off). The default log level is 'info' for all devices unless a device ID and an optional LUN was provided when setting the level.
.TP
.BR \-P\fI " " \fIACCESS_TOKEN_FILE
Enable authentication and read the access token from the specified file. The access token file must be owned by root and must be readable by root only.
.TP
.BR \-R\fI " " \fISCAN_DEPTH
Scan for image files recursively, up to a depth of SCAN_DEPTH. Depth 0 means to ignore any folders within the default image folder. Be careful when using this option with many sub-folders in the default image folder. The default depth is 1.
.TP
.BR \-h\fI " " \fI
Show a help page.
.TP
.BR \-n\fI " " \fIVENDOR:PRODUCT:REVISION
Set the vendor, product and revision for the device, to be returned with the INQUIRY data. A complete set of name components must be provided. VENDOR may have up to 8, PRODUCT up to 16, REVISION up to 4 characters. Padding with blanks to the maxium length is automatically applied. Once set the name of a device cannot be changed.
.TP
.BR \-p\fI " " \fIPORT
The s2p client service port, default is 6868.
.TP
.BR \-r\fI " " \fIRESERVED_IDS
Comma-separated list of IDs to reserve. Pass an empty list in order to not reserve anything.
.TP
.BR \-t\fI " " \fITYPE
The optional case-insensitive device type (SAHD, SCHD, SCRM, SCCD, SCMO, SCDP, SCLP, SCHS). If no type is specified for devices that support an image file, s2p tries to derive the type from the file extension.
.TP
.BR \-v\fI " " \fI
Displays the s2p version.
.TP
.BR \-z\fI " "\fILOCALE
Overrides the default locale for client-facing error messages. The client can override the locale.
.TP
.BR \-hd\fI " "\fIn[:u] " " \fIFILE
n is the SASI ID number (0-7). u (0-1) is the optional LUN (logical unit). The default LUN is 0.
.IP
FILE is the name of the image file to use for the SASI hard drive.
.TP
.BR \-id \fI " "\fIn[:u] " " \fIFILE
n is the SCSI ID number (0-7). u (0-31) is the optional LUN (logical unit). The default LUN is 0.
.IP
FILE is the name of the image file to use for the SCSI device. For devices that do not support an image file the filename may have a special meaning or a dummy name can be provided. For SCDP it is an optional prioritized list of network interfaces, an optional IP address and netmask, e.g. "interface=eth0,eth1,wlan0:inet=10.10.20.1/24". For SCLP it is the print command to be used and a reservation timeout in seconds, e.g. "cmd=lp -oraw %f:timeout=60".
.IP
FILE is the name of the image file to use for the SCSI device.

.SH EXAMPLES
Launch s2p with no devices attached:
   s2p

Launch s2p with an Apple hard drive image as ID 0 and a CD-ROM as ID 2
   s2p -id 0 /path/to/harddrive.hda -id 2 /path/to/cdimage.iso

Launch s2p with a removable SCSI drive image as ID 0 and the raw device file /dev/hdb (e.g. a USB stick) and a DaynaPort network adapter as ID 6:
   s2p -id 0 -t scrm /dev/hdb -id 6 daynaport

To create an empty 100 MiB drive image, use the following command:
   dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/newimage.hda bs=512 count=204800

In case the fallocate command is available a much faster alternative to the dd command is:
   fallocate -l 104857600 /path/to/newimage.hda
