.SH DESCRIPTION
.B s2pdump
has two modes of operation: dump and restore. These can be used with physical storage media like hard drives and magneto optical drives. Dump mode can be used with read-only media such as CD/DVD drives.

When operating in dump mode, s2pdump will copy all data from a remote drive to an image on the local filesystem. Optionally it generates a .properties file for the web UI. This file can be used to more closely emulate the source drive.

In restore mode s2pdump copies the data from a local image to a remote physical drive. The remote drive must be writable. 

.SH NOTES

.B s2pdump
requires either a FULLSPEC PiSCSI/RaSCSI board.

If the generated drive image is intended to be used with SCSI2Pi, the drive image should be moved to the ~/images folder (or the location specified to s2p).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-i\fI " "\fIID[:LUN]
SCSI ID and optional LUN of the SCSI drive. This device will be functioning as the "Target" device.
.TP
.BR \-B\fI " "\fIBID
SCSI ID of the SCSI2Pi board. If not specified ID 7 is used. The SCSI2Pi host will be functioning as the "initiator" device.
.TP
.BR \-f\fI " "\fIFILE
Path to the dump file.
.TP
.BR \-b\fI " "\fIBUFFER_SIZE
The transfer buffer size in bytes. The default size is 1 MiB. The buffer size is specified in bytes with a minimum value of 65536 bytes (64 KiB).
.TP
.BR \-r\fI
Run in restore mode. Default is dump mode.
.TP
.BR \-I\fI " "\fIID[:LUN]
Display INQUIRY data of ID[:LUN] and device properties to be used with s2p property files.
.TP
.BR \-L\fI " " \fILOG_LEVEL
Set the log level (trace, debug, info, warning, error, off). The default log level is 'info'.
.TP
.BR \-s\fI
Scan the bus for devices and display their properties.
.TP
.BR \-S\fI "  " \fISTART
Start sector for the dump/restore operation, default is 0.
.TP
.BR \-C\fI "  " \fICOUNT
Sector count, default is the drive capacity.

.SH EXAMPLES
Dump Mode: [SCSI Drive] ---> [SCSI2Pi host]
Launch s2pdump to dump all data from SCSI ID 3 with a dump buffer size of 128 KiB, store it on the local filesystem as a drive image named outimage.hds, and generate the outimage.hds.properties file with the drive's INQUIRY information:
   s2pdump -i 3 -f outimage.hds -b 131072 -p

Restore Mode: [SCSI2Pi host] ---> [SCSI Drive]
Launch s2pdump to restore/upload a drive image from the local file system to SCSI ID 0 with a restore buffer size 1 MiB:
   s2pdump -r -i 0 -f outimage.hds -b 1048576
