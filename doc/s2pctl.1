.SH DESCRIPTION
.B s2pctl
sends commands to s2p in order to make configuration adjustments at runtime or to check the device status.

Either the -i or -l option should be specified at one time. Not both. 

You do not need root privileges to use s2pctl. s2pctl also runs on non-Pi Linux platforms. In this case use the -h option to specify the s2p host s2pctl shall connect to.

Note: The command and type arguments are case insensitive. Only the first letter of the command/type is evaluated.

.TP 
.BR \-u\fI " " \fIUNIT
Unit number (0-31 for SCSI, 0-1 for SASI). This defaults to 0. This option is only used when there are multiple SCSI/SASI devices for the same SCSI ID.

.SH EXAMPLES
Show a listing of all devices and their current status.
   s2pctl -l


Example output:
