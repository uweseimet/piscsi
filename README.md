# What is SCSI2Pi?

SCSI2Pi is the advanced SCSI/SASI device emulation software for the PiSCSI/RaSCSI board. It offers additional and improved device emulations, higher transfer rates, new SCSI initiator mode tools, a SCSI-to-USB bridge and <a href="https://www.scsi2pi.net/en/piscsi_comparison.html">numerous other new features</a>. SCSI2Pi is compatible with the PiSCSI web UI and the <a href="https://www.scsi2pi.net/en/app.html">SCSI Control app</a> for Android.<br />
SCSI2Pi emulates hard drives, MO drives, CD-ROM drives, tape drives (streamers), printers, network adapters and a realtime clock. The SCSI-to-USB bridge and advanced streamer features like variable block sizes, navigation and filemarks make SCSI2Pi the presumably most versatile SCSI emulation available. You can easily add a range of devices to computers like old Macs, Atari ST/TT/Falcon030, Amiga, workstations or samplers. What about using a USB stick with your 68K-Mac or Atari, for instance?<br />
Either run SCSI2Pi stand-alone or switch from PiSCSI to SCSI2Pi in seconds, simply by installing a <a href="https://www.scsi2pi.net/en/installation.html">package with highly optimized SCSI2Pi binaries</a>.

# Who am I?

Until release 24.04.01 I was the <a href="https://www.scsi2pi.net/en/scsi2pi.html">main contributor</a> to the PiSCSI SCSI emulation. I revised the backend architecture, added a client API and re-engineered most of the legacy code so that it uses modern C++. The result is modern, modular code and drastically improved <a href="https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=uweseimet_scsi2pi">SonarQube code metrics</a>. Besides adding <a href="https://www.scsi2pi.net/en/scsi2pi.html">new features</a> and improving the compatibility with many platforms, I also fixed numerous bugs and added an extensive set of unit tests.<br />
I am also the author of the <a href="https://www.hddriver.net">HDDRIVER software package for Atari computers</a> and the <a href="https://www.scsi2pi.net/en/app.html">SCSI Control app</a> for Android, which is the remote control for PiSCSI/RaSCSI boards. SCSI Control supports both SCSI2Pi and PiSCSI. The full range of app features requires SCSI2Pi, though, because PiSCSI lacks new functionality and device types.

# How is SCSI2Pi related to PiSCSI?

In the PiSCSI project there was hardly any interest in replacing old, often broken or unnecessary code. Long promised features have never been addressed, and it took long for changes to make it into a release. This is why I decided to not contribute to PiSCSI anymore but to improve the emulation in a separate project, while staying compatible with the PiSCSI web interface. SCSI2Pi has been evolving with a much faster pace than PiSCSI since then.<br />
With PiSCSI there was also not much interest in exploiting the initiator mode of the FULLSPEC PiSCSI board. A set of new SCSI2Pi command line tools make use of this mode and address numerous use cases. They help with hard drive/tape backups, analzying/creating SIMH-compatible image files, formatting floppy disks or other media in USB drives, or with advanced testing. Some of these tools also run on a regular Linux or BSD PC and even on a Mac.<br />
The <a href="https://www.scsi2pi.net">SCSI2Pi website</a> offers an <a href="https://www.scsi2pi.net/en/piscsi_comparison.html">overview on differences between SCSI2Pi and PiSCSI</a> and a lot of other useful information.
