# What is SCSI2Pi?

SCSI2Pi is the advanced SCSI/SASI device emulation software for the PiSCSI/RaSCSI board. It offers additional and improved device emulations, higher transfer rates, new SCSI initiator mode tools and <a href="https://www.scsi2pi.net/en/piscsi_comparison.html">numerous other new features</a>. SCSI2Pi is compatible with the PiSCSI web UI and the <a href="https://www.scsi2pi.net/en/app.html">SCSI Control app</a> for Android.<br />
SCSI2Pi emulates several hard drives, MO drives, CD-ROM drives, streamers, printers, network adapters and a realtime clock. SCSI2Pi also offers a SCSI-to-USB bridge. This bridge and advanced streamer features like variable block sizes, spacing and filemarks make SCSI2Pi the presumably most versatile SCSI emulation. You can easily add a range of devices to computers like old Macs, Atari ST/TT/Falcon030, Amiga, workstations or samplers.<br />
You can run SCSI2Pi stand-alone or switch from PiSCSI to SCSI2Pi in seconds, simply by installing a <a href="https://www.scsi2pi.net/en/installation.html">package with highly optimized SCSI2Pi binaries</a>. No time-consuming compilation is required.<br />
The <a href="https://www.scsi2pi.net">SCSI2Pi website</a> addresses users and developers, whereas the information on GitHub is rather developer-centric.

# Who am I?

Until release 24.04.01 I was the <a href="https://www.scsi2pi.net/en/scsi2pi.html">main contributor</a> to the PiSCSI SCSI emulation. I revised the backend architecture, added a remote interface and re-engineered most of the legacy code so that it uses modern C++. This resulted in more modular code and drastically improved <a href="https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=uweseimet_scsi2pi">SonarQube code metrics</a>. Besides adding numerous <a href="https://www.scsi2pi.net/en/scsi2pi.html">new features</a> and improving the compatibility with many platforms, I also fixed many bugs and added an extensive set of unit tests.<br />
I am also the author of the <a href="https://www.hddriver.net">HDDRIVER driver software for Atari computers</a> and the <a href="https://www.scsi2pi.net/en/app.html">SCSI Control app</a> for Android, which is the remote control for PiSCSI/RaSCSI boards. SCSI Control supports both SCSI2Pi and PiSCSI. The full range of app features requires SCSI2Pi, though, because PiSCSI lacks new functionality.

# How is SCSI2Pi related to PiSCSI?

In the PiSCSI project there was not much interest in replacing old, often buggy or unnecessary code, or to improve the transfer rates. Long promised features and user requests in tickets have never been addressed, and it took long for features or bug fixes to make it into a release. This is why I started to work on the emulation in a separate project, while staying compatible with the PiSCSI web interface. The major part of the PiSCSI C++ codebase was contributed by me anyway. SCSI2Pi is not meant to fully replace the PiSCSI software, but only the device emulation and the tools.<br />
With PiSCSI there was also not much interest in further developing the SCSI emulation and exploiting the initiator mode feature of the FULLSPEC board. This mode, together with several SCSI2Pi command line tools, offers solutions for use cases that have never been addressed before. Some of these tools also run on a regular Linux or BSD PC and even on a Mac. They help with hard drive/tape backups, analzying/creating SIMH-compatible image files, or with advanced testing.<br />
The SCSI2Pi website offers an <a href="https://www.scsi2pi.net/en/piscsi_comparison.html">overview on differences between SCSI2Pi and PiSCSI</a>.
